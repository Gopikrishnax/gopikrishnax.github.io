        I am originally from San Diego, CA where I attended MiraCosta Community
        College from 2011 - 2014. I continued my studies at the University of
        California - Davis from 2014 to 2016, where I graduated with a Bachelor
        of Science in Applied Mathematics. Upon graduating, I took Udacity's
        Full Stack Nanodegree where I got my first exposure to Web Development.
        I completed the course within two months and kept up my studies through
        other online platforms like freeCodeCamp and tylermcginnis.com, and I
        even completed a second Nanodegree on Udacity - the React Nanodegree.
