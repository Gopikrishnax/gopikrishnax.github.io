I always had a small confusion between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript. My confusion got cleared, after reading **JS Grammar** by [@js_tut](https://twitter.com/js_tut). 

Checkout [JS Grammer](https://twitter.com/js_tut), It's an awesome resource to learn JavaScript.

Now, Let's dive into the topic.

When we declare a variable without assigning any value to it, its value will be `undefined` by default.

```js
let color;
console.log(color); //undefined
```

But when we assign `null` to a variable, we are explicitly assigning a "nothing" or "empty" value to it.

For example, we have a _user_, whose details are unknown

```js
let userDetails = null;
```

Later we fill the `userDetails` variable with the response from our function `getUserDetails`. The function may be a call to an API or accessing `localStorage` for details etc. Here itâ€™s a simple function which returns an Object.

```js
function getUserDetails() {
  return {
    userName: 'gk',
    id: '1',
  };
}

userDetails = getUserDetails();
console.log(userDetails); // {userName:"gk", id:"1"}
```
